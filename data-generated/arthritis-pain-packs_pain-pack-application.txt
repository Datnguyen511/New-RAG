Thank you for your interest in our Pain Pack.
Our new Pain Pack is a FREE box of products and services for combatting pain, along with appropriate health information and discounts for relevant products and services. The pack addresses strategies to mitigate chronic arthritic pain including, physical exercise and joint strengthening, thermotherapy (heat cream and heat packs), nutrition and mindfulness.
Eligibility
During the pilot period, the Arthritis NSW Pain Pack is only applicable to individuals diagnosed with
osteoarthritis
only available to
residents of:
South Eastern NSW
Bega Valley

Disclaimers
Rheumatoid Arthritis:
If you live with an inflammatory form of arthritis (e.g. Rheumatoid arthritis), this pain pack may not be optimal for you as it relates to more conservative management approaches to pain. Tailored medication/medical management is the higher priority for individuals experiencing RA-related pain overseen by a rheumatologist
Complex Pain:
If you indicate that you experience pain from a condition that is not osteoarthritis. You may require more individualised or specific support in managing your pain. We encourage you to discuss these strategies with your GP and/or seek a referral to a Rheumatologist.
We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause to those outside the specified criteria but please
complete the Expression of Interest form
and we will contact you when packs are available in your area.
