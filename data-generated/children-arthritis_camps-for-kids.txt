Camps for Kids
--------------
Support & understanding for children and young people with JIA
Our goal is to help children and young people with arthritis – as well as their families – to develop the self-management skills they will enable them to enjoy full and active lives.
Our camps provide children and young people living with juvenile arthritis an opportunity to participate in fun and educational activities, in a safe and supportive environment, without fear of being different.
We deliver an annual camp and a day-out for children affected by juvenile arthritis:
Camp Footloose
Camp Footloose is a week long educational sport and recreational camp for children and young people with juvenile arthritis aged 9 to 18 years.
Twinkletoes
Twinkletoes is designed to help families caring for young children under the age of 8 years with juvenile arthritis - with a focus on a fun day out.
