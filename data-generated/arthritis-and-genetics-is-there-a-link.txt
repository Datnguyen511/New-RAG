Arthritis and Genetics, is there a link?
----------------------------------------

Inflammatory Arthritis
----------------------
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
RA is an auto-immune disease. It is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis. Some environmental factors – such as infection, injury, smoking, or occupational exposures – may be linked with RA in some people.
Genetic factors are also linked to cases of RA. People who are close relatives to those with RA and are also born with variations in the HLA genes, are more likely to develop RA. Research has shown that genetic factors contribute to about 50-60% risk for developing RA.
HLA genes help your immune system identify which proteins your body makes, and those from viruses and bacteria. It is important to note that not everyone with these genetic markers develops RA, and those without the genetic markers can still develop RA.
Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
AS is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine, causing inflammation, pain, and eventually leading to the fusion of vertebrae. AS causes inflammation in the joints of the neck, back and pelvis.
Approximately 90% of patients with AS carry an HLA-B27 gene. However, not everyone with the gene will develop AS, and some people without the HLA-B27 gene develop it, this suggests that other genetic and environmental factors also play a role.
People that have family members with AS are more likely to develop the disease, while those without the gene and no family history are less likely to develop AS.
Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)
PsA is a form of arthritis that affects some people with psoriasis, a skin condition. It is believed that around 40% of people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of psoriasis or arthritis, indicating a strong genetic component.
Specific genes, such as those in the HLA family, have been implicated in the development of psoriatic arthritis.
Lupus
Lupus seems to have a hereditary component. Current research is identifying how genetic variations can cause susceptibility to lupus. This research is predicting whether a person will develop lupus, as well as its severity and what treatments will work best for those with genetic variations.
If a family member, particularly a first-degree relative like a parent or sibling, has lupus, your risk of developing the disease can be higher. Certain genes, particularly those involved in immune system regulation, have been linked to lupus.
For example, variations in genes related to the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) system, which is crucial for immune function, can be associated with an increased risk of lupus.
However, not everyone with these genes will develop lupus, as environmental factors, hormonal influences, and lifestyle also play significant roles.
Scleroderma
Genetics play a role in the disease, but it is not passed on from parents to children. Some studies suggest that certain genetic mutations or variations might nmake someone more likely to develop scleroderma, particularly when combined with environmental triggers.
Overall, the exact causes of scleroderma are unknown, however some known risk factors for scleroderma are–gender (being born female), age, race (European descent), and environmental exposure.
Non-Inflammatory Arthritis
Osteoarthritis (OA)
OA is the most common form of non-inflammatory arthritis. For some people, genetic factors may increase their risk of OA, for example mutations in genes for collagen.
However other risk factors for OA can include being overweight, joint injuries, ageing and joint anatomy.

People that have family members with AS are more likely to develop the disease, while those without the gene and no family history are less likely to develop AS.
Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)
PsA is a form of arthritis that affects some people with psoriasis, a skin condition. It is believed that around 40% of people with psoriatic arthritis have a family history of psoriasis or arthritis, indicating a strong genetic component.
Specific genes, such as those in the HLA family, have been implicated in the development of psoriatic arthritis.
Lupus
Lupus seems to have a hereditary component. Current research is identifying how genetic variations can cause susceptibility to lupus. This research is predicting whether a person will develop lupus, as well as its severity and what treatments will work best for those with genetic variations.
If a family member, particularly a first-degree relative like a parent or sibling, has lupus, your risk of developing the disease can be higher. Certain genes, particularly those involved in immune system regulation, have been linked to lupus.
For example, variations in genes related to the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) system, which is crucial for immune function, can be associated with an increased risk of lupus.
However, not everyone with these genes will develop lupus, as environmental factors, hormonal influences, and lifestyle also play significant roles.
Scleroderma
Genetics play a role in the disease, but it is not passed on from parents to children. Some studies suggest that certain genetic mutations or variations might nmake someone more likely to develop scleroderma, particularly when combined with environmental triggers.
Overall, the exact causes of scleroderma are unknown, however some known risk factors for scleroderma are–gender (being born female), age, race (European descent), and environmental exposure.
Non-Inflammatory Arthritis
Osteoarthritis (OA)
OA is the most common form of non-inflammatory arthritis. For some people, genetic factors may increase their risk of OA, for example mutations in genes for collagen.
However other risk factors for OA can include being overweight, joint injuries, ageing and joint anatomy.

Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)
---------------------------
AS is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine, causing inflammation, pain, and eventually leading to the fusion of vertebrae. AS causes inflammation in the joints of the neck, back and pelvis.
Approximately 90% of patients with AS carry an HLA-B27 gene. However, not everyone with the gene will develop AS, and some people without the HLA-B27 gene develop it, this suggests that other genetic and environmental factors also play a role.
People that have family members with AS are more likely to develop the disease, while those without the gene and no family history are less likely to develop AS.

For some types of arthritis, people who are a parent, child, or sibling of someone with arthritis, may be at risk of developing a similar condition.
It is very likely that genes play a part of developing some types of arthritis. But the exact role of genetics is still not well known.
RA is an auto-immune disease. It is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis. Some environmental factors – such as infection, injury, smoking, or occupational exposures – may be linked with RA in some people.
Genetic factors are also linked to cases of RA. People who are close relatives to those with RA and are also born with variations in the HLA genes, are more likely to develop RA. Research has shown that genetic factors contribute to about 50-60% risk for developing RA.
HLA genes help your immune system identify which proteins your body makes, and those from viruses and bacteria. It is important to note that not everyone with these genetic markers develops RA, and those without the genetic markers can still develop RA.
AS is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine, causing inflammation, pain, and eventually leading to the fusion of vertebrae. AS causes inflammation in the joints of the neck, back and pelvis.
