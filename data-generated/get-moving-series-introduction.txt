Get Moving! Exercise Series | The Arthritis Movement - ANSW
===========================================================

Get Moving! Exercise Series
---------------------------
It is extremely important to stay moving, fit and healthy for both our physical and mental health. Staying fit can significantly reduce the risk of developing or the progression of sedentary diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and reduce development and/or severity of arthritis.  If you are having a bad day with arthritis, gentle movement and choosing just a couple of the exercises will boost blood flow and reduce the ‘stiffening’ that happens when we stop moving.
