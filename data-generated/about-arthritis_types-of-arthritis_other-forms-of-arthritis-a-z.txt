Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (children)
Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a disease affecting the bones. Inflammation is normally one of the body’s protective responses to infection or injury, but in diseases such as CRMO, uncontrolled inflammation can cause damage. In CRMO, inflammation targets the bone and can occur throughout the body.

Fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia is a name given to a common group of symptoms marked by generalised pain and muscle stiffness, as well as extreme fatigue.These may range from very mild to severe, and may last for many years or come and go at different times. With the right advice most people find they learn to manage the pain and tiredness over time.

Familial Mediterranean Fever
Giant Cell Arteritis
Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) is a condition where the body attacks its own blood vessels. GCA can affect the main artery in the heart and smaller blood vessels in the head. This can interrupt blood flow and can also cause pain, inflammation and tenderness around the temples. Because of this, the condition is also known as ‘temporal arteritis’. Around 1,000 Australians are diagnosed with GCA each year.

Growing Pains
Haemochromatosis and haemochromatotic arthritis
Haemochromatosis is a condition caused by a build-up of iron in your body. People with haemochromatosis absorb too much iron from food (iron overload) and the extra iron can damage organs, particularly the liver, heart, pancreas, bones and joints.

Haemochromatosis
Hypermobility syndromes (children)
We are at our most flexible as babies and become less flexible with age. Many children are hypermobile (“double jointed”) in one or more joints. When this affects many joints, and is associated with pain, it is called a hypermobility syndrome.

Hypermobility Syndromes
Juvenile dermatomyositis (children)
Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is a rare condition that causes inflammation of the skin and muscle. Inflammation is one of the body’s protective responses to infection or injury, but in diseases such as JDM, uncontrolled inflammation can cause damage. Other parts of the body may also be affected such as the lung and intestines.

Non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis
Non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) is an autoimmune disease which causes arthritis in the spine and pelvis. While ‘non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis’ is a very complicated name, it can be understood as:
Non-radiographic
: the inflammation will not show up on an x-ray (radiograph) but may show up on an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan.
Axial:
it mainly affects the spine (rather than arms or legs).
Spondyloarthritis
: arthritis that affects the joints as well as sites where ligaments and tendons join the bone.

Non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis
Polymyalgia rheumatica
Polymyalgia rheumatica means ‘pain in many muscles’. It is a condition that causes inflammation of the joints and tissues around the joints. This causes muscles to feel painful and stiff, especially in the shoulder, neck and hip areas. Polymyalgia rheumatica is different to fibromyalgia, a condition that does not cause inflammation.

Giant Cell Arteritis
Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) is a condition where the body attacks its own blood vessels. GCA can affect the main artery in the heart and smaller blood vessels in the head. This can interrupt blood flow and can also cause pain, inflammation and tenderness around the temples. Because of this, the condition is also known as ‘temporal arteritis’. Around 1,000 Australians are diagnosed with GCA each year.

Juvenile dermatomyositis (children)
Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is a rare condition that causes inflammation of the skin and muscle. Inflammation is one of the body’s protective responses to infection or injury, but in diseases such as JDM, uncontrolled inflammation can cause damage. Other parts of the body may also be affected such as the lung and intestines.

Non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis
Non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) is an autoimmune disease which causes arthritis in the spine and pelvis. While ‘non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis’ is a very complicated name, it can be understood as:
Non-radiographic
: the inflammation will not show up on an x-ray (radiograph) but may show up on an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan.
Axial:
it mainly affects the spine (rather than arms or legs).
Spondyloarthritis
: arthritis that affects the joints as well as sites where ligaments and tendons join the bone.

Non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) is an autoimmune disease which causes arthritis in the spine and pelvis. While ‘non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis’ is a very complicated name, it can be understood as:
Non-radiographic
: the inflammation will not show up on an x-ray (radiograph) but may show up on an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan.
Axial:
it mainly affects the spine (rather than arms or legs).
Spondyloarthritis
: arthritis that affects the joints as well as sites where ligaments and tendons join the bone.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (children)
Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a disease affecting the bones. Inflammation is normally one of the body’s protective responses to infection or injury, but in diseases such as CRMO, uncontrolled inflammation can cause damage. In CRMO, inflammation targets the bone and can occur throughout the body.

Giant Cell Arteritis
Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) is a condition where the body attacks its own blood vessels. GCA can affect the main artery in the heart and smaller blood vessels in the head. This can interrupt blood flow and can also cause pain, inflammation and tenderness around the temples. Because of this, the condition is also known as ‘temporal arteritis’. Around 1,000 Australians are diagnosed with GCA each year.

Juvenile dermatomyositis (children)
Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is a rare condition that causes inflammation of the skin and muscle. Inflammation is one of the body’s protective responses to infection or injury, but in diseases such as JDM, uncontrolled inflammation can cause damage. Other parts of the body may also be affected such as the lung and intestines.

Non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis
Non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) is an autoimmune disease which causes arthritis in the spine and pelvis. While ‘non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis’ is a very complicated name, it can be understood as:
Non-radiographic
: the inflammation will not show up on an x-ray (radiograph) but may show up on an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan.
Axial:
it mainly affects the spine (rather than arms or legs).
Spondyloarthritis
: arthritis that affects the joints as well as sites where ligaments and tendons join the bone.

Non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) is an autoimmune disease which causes arthritis in the spine and pelvis. While ‘non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis’ is a very complicated name, it can be understood as:
Non-radiographic
: the inflammation will not show up on an x-ray (radiograph) but may show up on an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan.
Axial:
it mainly affects the spine (rather than arms or legs).
Spondyloarthritis
: arthritis that affects the joints as well as sites where ligaments and tendons join the bone.

Polymyalgia rheumatica
Polymyalgia rheumatica means ‘pain in many muscles’. It is a condition that causes inflammation of the joints and tissues around the joints. This causes muscles to feel painful and stiff, especially in the shoulder, neck and hip areas. Polymyalgia rheumatica is different to fibromyalgia, a condition that does not cause inflammation.

Reactive arthritis
Reactive arthritis is a condition that causes inflammation, pain and swelling of the joints. It usually develops after an infection, often in the bowel or genital areas. The infection causes activity in the immune system.

Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus
Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus are infections that are spread to humans through mosquito bites. They cause similar illnesses, including joint inflammation and pain. People of all ages are at risk of developing these infections. Ross River virus is the most common and widespread of mosquito borne diseases that infect humans in Australia.

Haemochromatosis and haemochromatotic arthritis
-----------------------------------------------
Haemochromatosis is a condition caused by a build-up of iron in your body. People with haemochromatosis absorb too much iron from food (iron overload) and the extra iron can damage organs, particularly the liver, heart, pancreas, bones and joints.

Hypermobility syndromes (children)
We are at our most flexible as babies and become less flexible with age. Many children are hypermobile (“double jointed”) in one or more joints. When this affects many joints, and is associated with pain, it is called a hypermobility syndrome.

Juvenile dermatomyositis (children)
Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is a rare condition that causes inflammation of the skin and muscle. Inflammation is one of the body’s protective responses to infection or injury, but in diseases such as JDM, uncontrolled inflammation can cause damage. Other parts of the body may also be affected such as the lung and intestines.

: the inflammation will not show up on an x-ray (radiograph) but may show up on an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan.
it mainly affects the spine (rather than arms or legs).
: arthritis that affects the joints as well as sites where ligaments and tendons join the bone.
