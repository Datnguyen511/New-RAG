Get Moving! Plus Exercise Series | The Arthritis Movement - ANSW
================================================================

Get Moving! Plus Exercise Series
--------------------------------
Get Moving!
PLUS
is not an exercise library for ‘fitness’ purposes per se, instead, it’s an exercise library dedicated to promoting and improving the mobility and strength of joints and muscles that are affected by arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions. Many of the mobility exercises included are low risk of injury and are easy to perform, though some are a little complex. For example, some require a resistance band, towel or other equipment, other exercises are self-assisted (using your hands to create force or a block, or to promote a specific direction of movement), while some require a certain range of motion (ROM), balance and/or coordination ability.
Unlike the Get Moving! Series, there are no ‘fitness’ profiling levels, which means that anyone at any age can perform the exercises given their circumstance and ability. These exercises are not to get you ‘fit’ but to get your joint ‘fit’ in a specific context, ie. pre and/or post rehabilitation settings, severe arthritis and/or pain. Exercises are grouped by joint and mobility attribute with a range of regressed and progressed exercises that can be used for a variety of purposes.
Kat Keane, our Health Services Educator, explains the Series in the Intro video that follows.
Why was it created?
Get Moving! PLUS was created out of both demand from consumers wanting exercises for specific joints and the need for freely available, high quality, joint specific mobility exercises. Get Moving! PLUS may be used to complement treatment from a physiotherapist, exercise physiologist or myotherapist for either prehabilitation or rehabilitation from a joint replacement (or other) surgery, chronic pain and/or restricted movement in the context of arthritis.
Please note: we highly recommend that the use of this resource is a collaborative one, ie. you work with your allied healthcare professional for exercise recommendation and assistance.

“As a physiotherapist working with patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis, I am aware that exercise is one of the most effective, evidence-based treatments available. Whilst we don’t yet have a “cure” for osteoarthritis, exercise can be powerful tool to help manage your symptoms and allow you to live a more normal life. Get Moving! PLUS is a comprehensive, free, online resource designed by Arthritis NSW specifically for people who suffer from joint pain of the hip, knee or ankle. It forms a curated collection of targeted, joint-specific exercises, designed to help alleviate stiffness, increase muscle strength and improve balance. It is very pleasing to see a resource that provides appropriate, evidence-based exercises and information whilst also being available at no cost to the consumer. In a modern world that can often be hard to find!
Whilst this resource should not be seen as a replacement for usual care – whether that be consultation with a GP, physiotherapist or exercise physiologist – it should be seen as an additional tool for both clinicians and those with joint pain. Those with more complex needs will almost certainly require an individual assessment and 1:1 guidance, particularly when first starting an exercise program. Those who are progressing well with their exercises or looking for some new joint-specific exercises and want to proactively manage their symptoms should find Get Moving! PLUS very useful.”

Stacey is a Hand Physiotherapist and Senior Clinician at the Royal North Shore hospital. Stacey kindly provided ANSW with consultation, expertise and endorsement of the hand section of Get Moving! PLUS.
“Arthritis affecting the hand and wrist can be quite debilitating. It can cause pain and stiffness which when worse enough can affect functional activities. Physiotherapists or occupational therapists can work closely with people who have arthritis affecting their wrist, fingers and thumb, utilising evidence-based treatments such as range of motion and strengthening exercises of the wrist and hand to stabilise and support joints, aiming to reduce pain and optimise function.
Get Moving! PLUS is a wonderful resource produced by Arthritis NSW in consultation with Physiotherapists. Get Moving! Plus is designed to assist people with arthritis to perform range of motion and strengthening exercises in the comfort of their own home. It can be tailored to your specific needs by choosing exercises which are appropriate for you. This resource should be used in consultation with your GP, rheumatologist or treating therapist. People with more complex pain and impairments will benefit from a comprehensive assessment and individualised program designed by their physiotherapist. Discuss the Get Moving! Plus tool with your treating health professional so that it can be integrated into your daily exercise program.”

Get Moving!
is not an exercise library for ‘fitness’ purposes per se, instead, it’s an exercise library dedicated to promoting and improving the mobility and strength of joints and muscles that are affected by arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions. Many of the mobility exercises included are low risk of injury and are easy to perform, though some are a little complex. For example, some require a resistance band, towel or other equipment, other exercises are self-assisted (using your hands to create force or a block, or to promote a specific direction of movement), while some require a certain range of motion (ROM), balance and/or coordination ability.
Unlike the Get Moving! Series, there are no ‘fitness’ profiling levels, which means that anyone at any age can perform the exercises given their circumstance and ability. These exercises are not to get you ‘fit’ but to get your joint ‘fit’ in a specific context, ie. pre and/or post rehabilitation settings, severe arthritis and/or pain. Exercises are grouped by joint and mobility attribute with a range of regressed and progressed exercises that can be used for a variety of purposes.
Kat Keane, our Health Services Educator, explains the Series in the Intro video that follows.
Get Moving! PLUS was created out of both demand from consumers wanting exercises for specific joints and the need for freely available, high quality, joint specific mobility exercises. Get Moving! PLUS may be used to complement treatment from a physiotherapist, exercise physiologist or myotherapist for either prehabilitation or rehabilitation from a joint replacement (or other) surgery, chronic pain and/or restricted movement in the context of arthritis.
Andrew Wood is a physiotherapist and the Osteoarthritis Chronic Care Program (OACCP) Coordinator and Canterbury Hospital. Andrew kindly provided ANSW with consultation, expertise and endorsement of the lower body sections of Get Moving! PLUS.
Stacey is a Hand Physiotherapist and Senior Clinician at the Royal North Shore hospital. Stacey kindly provided ANSW with consultation, expertise and endorsement of the hand section of Get Moving! PLUS.
