Arthritis does not discriminate. Children as young as one have been diagnosed with juvenile arthritis and the latest statistics show that 6000 children in Australia have the condition.
The pain and stiffness of juvenile arthritis limits a child’s range of movement and ability to be active. This can challenge their self-esteem, sense of adventure and feelings of belonging.
Arthritis NSW needs your support to help the many children and families affected by this disease. Our programs include our annual children’s camps, Camp Twinkletoes and Camp Footloose, which provide education and support to families and young people.
