Keeping active is vital for people living with arthritis. This is because exercise increases strength and flexibility which can help to decrease arthritis symptoms like joint pain and fatigue.
Several studies have found people suffering from arthritis had improvement in mobility and joint pain, as well as positive changes in depression, anxiety, fatigue and tension when participating in a dance program once a week.
We ave partnered with
Queensland Ballet
to develop this ONLINE group dance program to help people living with arthritis to get active with movements that are safe and beneficial to arthritis management.
Queensland Ballet is a professional ballet company that offers inclusive workshops and endeavours to connect people and dance.
