Arthritis Infoline
------------------
Our toll-free Arthritis Infoline can be accessed by calling 1800 011 041 and operates
9.00am to 5.00pm (AEST)
Monday to Friday.
The Arthritis Infoline lets you speak with a health professional about your condition.
There may be times when you are advised to go back and check something with your doctor or other treating health professional, particularly if the issue relates to medicine dosage. This is because your treating health professional understands your overall health and any other conditions you may have, so it may be better to talk through an issue with them.
Wherever possible, however, we will try to answer your questions and guide you to where you can best access information.
