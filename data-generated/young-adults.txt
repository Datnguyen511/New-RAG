Arthritis isn’t just for the elderly; it can affect young adults and even teenagers.
While receiving such a diagnosis might initially cast a shadow on your ambitions and daily activities, it’s crucial to know that you’re not alone. Living with arthritis doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice your dreams or your quality of life. Whether it’s pursuing higher education, diving into your career, maintaining a bustling social calendar, or even starting a family, arthritis doesn’t have to be a roadblock.
We are committed to providing you with a wealth of resources, practical tips, and expert advice, tailored specifically for your unique needs as a young adult dealing with arthritis. Our aim is to empower you to lead a fulfilling life, on your terms.
Take the first step towards managing your condition more effectively. Explore our resources, connect with others who are in the same boat, and most importantly, don’t hesitate to seek professional advice.

It can be incredibly invalidating and disempowering when you tell some you have, for example, Psoriatic arthritis and they don’t understand the severity of it or think it’s an “old” persons condition.
For many people an anti-inflammatory diet is an effective way of controlling symptoms, maintaining a healthy weight and reducing the risk of developing other health problems.
Arthritis is a chronic health condition that affects not only our physical health, but also our mental wellbeing.
RA and similar conditions (e.g., Psoriatic Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis) can make its way into every aspect of your life, including your sex life.
If you’re living with arthritis, the journey to family planning and parenthood can be uncertain and bring about challenges.
Arthritis isn’t just for the elderly; it can affect young adults and even teenagers.
While receiving such a diagnosis might initially cast a shadow on your ambitions and daily activities, it’s crucial to know that you’re not alone. Living with arthritis doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice your dreams or your quality of life. Whether it’s pursuing higher education, diving into your career, maintaining a bustling social calendar, or even starting a family, arthritis doesn’t have to be a roadblock.
We are committed to providing you with a wealth of resources, practical tips, and expert advice, tailored specifically for your unique needs as a young adult dealing with arthritis. Our aim is to empower you to lead a fulfilling life, on your terms.
Take the first step towards managing your condition more effectively. Explore our resources, connect with others who are in the same boat, and most importantly, don’t hesitate to seek professional advice.
Navigating life with arthritis presents its own unique challenges, especially for young adults (18 – 35). That’s why we have developed the Chill & Chat program – an evolving platform designed to offer a safe and welcoming space where you can connect and share experiences.
Build lasting relationships with people who understand your journey.
