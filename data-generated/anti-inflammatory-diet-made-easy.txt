Anti-inflammatory diet – made easy
----------------------------------

What is an anti-inflammatory diet?
----------------------------------
An anti-inflammatory diet involves eating nutrient-rich, whole foods that reduce inflammation in the body. It contains plenty of fibre, antioxidants, and omega-3s. This means a diet rich in vegetables, whole fruit, whole grains, legumes, and fatty fish – that is as unprocessed as possible.
Include these anti-inflammatory foods:
Fresh vegetables
(all kinds) – Aim for a variety of types and colours (a rainbow of veggies provides phytonutrients) with a minimum of four to five servings per day – especially dark, leafy greens (spinach, kale, Asian greens) broccoli and cauliflower, brussel sprouts, beetroot
Whole pieces of fruit
(not juice that strips them of fibre) – three to four servings per day is a good amount for most people, especially berries and cherries
Fatty fish
– such as salmon, trout, sardines, mackerel & tuna
Herbs & spices
-turmeric, ginger, basil, oregano, thyme, cinnamon etc.,
Healthy fats
– extra virgin olive oil is the best option, avocado oil and the fats found in seeds, nuts, fish
Nuts/seeds
– such as walnuts, cashews, almonds, pistachios, pine nuts, chia, hemp
Whole grains –
brown rice, amaranth, buckwheat, and quinoa
Legumes/beans
– especially black beans, black-eyed peas, chickpeas, lentils, red kidney
Drinks
– water, green tea and organic coffee in moderation
Nightshades or not?
Eggplant, tomatoes, capsicum and potatoes – are central to Mediterranean cuisine. Some people believe they trigger arthritis flares, but there’s limited scientific evidence to support this theory. Some people may react as they have a food sensitivity to these vegetables. If you react consider replacing these vegetables with sweet potatoes, cauliflower or mushrooms.
The Mediterranean Diet is considered one of the healthiest diets and is also a good go-to for an anti-inflammatory diet. It also includes dairy such as yoghurt and cheese, good for calcium intake to prevent osteoporosis.
Avoid these inflammatory / processed foods
Processed meats
– sausages and cold cut meats – ham, salami etc.
Refined sugars
– found in soft drinks, cookies, cake, lollies, ice cream, some breakfast cereals
Trans fats
– found in deep fried foods, fast foods, commercially baked goods
Processed snack foods
– such as chips and crackers
Gluten, white bread & pasta
& too many carbohydrates
Soybean oil and vegetable oil
Alcohol
in excessive quantities

An update on ultra-processed food & poor health
Firstly what is processed food?
“Processed food” includes food that has been cooked, canned, frozen, packaged or changed in nutritional composition with fortifying, preserving or preparing in different ways. That is, packaged food that is no longer in its natural state.
Recent studies have found that a diet of ultra-processed food was associated with higher rates of disease and poor health. We know that ultra-processed foods tend to be higher in added sugar, salt and fat making them unhealthy. However, even if they have added nutrients, the evidence suggests that because they’re ultra-processed it doesn’t matter what we add to their nutrient content, it’s not going to make them a healthy option.
A recent study based in France, found increasing the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet by 10 per cent was associated with significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke). Another study based in Spain, found people who consumed more than four servings of ultra-processed food per day were 62 per cent more likely to die of any cause compared to those who had less than two servings per day.
In both studies, large groups of adults completed food intake questionnaires, then their rates of disease were tracked for up to 10 years.
We might need to reconsider what it is about these foods that makes them unhealthy, said Professor Lawrence, a food policy expert from Deakin University.
“It’s not just about the so-called ‘risky’ nutrients in foods,” he said. “The nature of the cause is associated with the physical and chemical changes that happen to the food as a result of this high degree of industrial processing.”
The findings provide further weight to the already sizeable pile of evidence that highly processed food is linked to poorer health.
Easy food swaps & meal ideas
Breakfast
Instead of white bread (crumpets and English muffins), butter, jam, Nutella, processed breakfast cereals, pancakes and bacon, try:
Avocado, nut spread (not peanut), banana/cinnamon on rye bread
Have porridge (whole oats) & berries– sweeten with a small amount of maple syrup or honey
Organic scrambled / boiled eggs with herbs or turmeric
Avocado & smoked salmon on whole grain bread
Granola with Greek yoghurt and berries
Lunch
Instead of hot chips, frozen meals, white bread sandwiches (cold cuts), pasta/potato/Caesar salads try:
Vegetable frittata with salad
Salads with a variety of fruit and vegetables – also add brown rice, quinoa and nuts to be more filling – dress with oil and vinegar and spices (not store-bought dressings); replace lettuce with spinach
Salmon cakes & salad
Lettuce wraps with salmon or trout, herbs and carrot/cucumber
Dinner
Instead of pizza, pasta, hamburgers, red meat roasts try:
Try one-tray bakes with fish, lean chicken and veggies (less washing up!)
Have minestrone soup instead of pumpkin soup – use a variety of veggies & herbs – count how many colours and types you can get in one soup
Replace side serves of pasta, white rice and potatoes with more veggies, salad or whole grains
Grill fish and veggies on the BBQ and service with a salad
Asian soups with salmon and greens
Snacks
Instead of chips, biscuits, cakes, chocolate, try:
A handful of nuts – roast them or buy roasted for some extra crunch and flavour
Kale chips – kale, olive oil and a small sprinkle of salt & roast in the oven
Toasted pita spread, carrots, cucumber with hummus or avocado dip
Mixed berries and Greek yoghurt
Grab a piece of fruit
Drinks
Instead of soft drinks and excessive alcohol, try:
Water with a squeeze of citrus or flavoured with cut up fruit
Mineral water
Green tea and organic coffee in moderation
Extra Tips
Buy fruit and veggies that are in season for freshness and to save money
Prepare a shopping list and stick to it…if it’s not in the pantry you can’t eat it!
Have plenty of health snacks on hand
Ask a partner, family member or friend to buddy up with you – provide each other support, encouragement and give each other ideas/recipes
Limit the amount of take-away food
Try different recipes and get a collection of ones that you enjoy – everyone has different tastes. See
Sources and Further Reading
below for some recipes ideas and inspiration
Make large batches and freeze where you can, to have something on hand
Be organised, plan your meals and it will then become easier as you go along
Give yourself an occasional treat, rather than stop trying all together!
We hope that you enjoy the great feeling and health outcomes from eating nutrient-rich, whole foods.
Please note!
If you need help from a health professional to get you started or think you have some food allergies or sensitivities, you may want to see a Dietician.

How bad diets around the world have led to 11 million deaths

An update on ultra-processed food & poor health
-----------------------------------------------
Firstly what is processed food?
“Processed food” includes food that has been cooked, canned, frozen, packaged or changed in nutritional composition with fortifying, preserving or preparing in different ways. That is, packaged food that is no longer in its natural state.
Recent studies have found that a diet of ultra-processed food was associated with higher rates of disease and poor health. We know that ultra-processed foods tend to be higher in added sugar, salt and fat making them unhealthy. However, even if they have added nutrients, the evidence suggests that because they’re ultra-processed it doesn’t matter what we add to their nutrient content, it’s not going to make them a healthy option.
A recent study based in France, found increasing the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet by 10 per cent was associated with significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke). Another study based in Spain, found people who consumed more than four servings of ultra-processed food per day were 62 per cent more likely to die of any cause compared to those who had less than two servings per day.
In both studies, large groups of adults completed food intake questionnaires, then their rates of disease were tracked for up to 10 years.
We might need to reconsider what it is about these foods that makes them unhealthy, said Professor Lawrence, a food policy expert from Deakin University.
“It’s not just about the so-called ‘risky’ nutrients in foods,” he said. “The nature of the cause is associated with the physical and chemical changes that happen to the food as a result of this high degree of industrial processing.”
The findings provide further weight to the already sizeable pile of evidence that highly processed food is linked to poorer health.
Easy food swaps & meal ideas
Breakfast
Instead of white bread (crumpets and English muffins), butter, jam, Nutella, processed breakfast cereals, pancakes and bacon, try:
Avocado, nut spread (not peanut), banana/cinnamon on rye bread
Have porridge (whole oats) & berries– sweeten with a small amount of maple syrup or honey
Organic scrambled / boiled eggs with herbs or turmeric
Avocado & smoked salmon on whole grain bread
Granola with Greek yoghurt and berries
Lunch
Instead of hot chips, frozen meals, white bread sandwiches (cold cuts), pasta/potato/Caesar salads try:
Vegetable frittata with salad
Salads with a variety of fruit and vegetables – also add brown rice, quinoa and nuts to be more filling – dress with oil and vinegar and spices (not store-bought dressings); replace lettuce with spinach
Salmon cakes & salad
Lettuce wraps with salmon or trout, herbs and carrot/cucumber
Dinner
Instead of pizza, pasta, hamburgers, red meat roasts try:
Try one-tray bakes with fish, lean chicken and veggies (less washing up!)
Have minestrone soup instead of pumpkin soup – use a variety of veggies & herbs – count how many colours and types you can get in one soup
Replace side serves of pasta, white rice and potatoes with more veggies, salad or whole grains
Grill fish and veggies on the BBQ and service with a salad
Asian soups with salmon and greens
Snacks
Instead of chips, biscuits, cakes, chocolate, try:
A handful of nuts – roast them or buy roasted for some extra crunch and flavour
Kale chips – kale, olive oil and a small sprinkle of salt & roast in the oven

Anti-inflammatory diet – made easy
----------------------------------

What is an anti-inflammatory diet?
----------------------------------
An anti-inflammatory diet involves eating nutrient-rich, whole foods that reduce inflammation in the body. It contains plenty of fibre, antioxidants, and omega-3s. This means a diet rich in vegetables, whole fruit, whole grains, legumes, and fatty fish – that is as unprocessed as possible.
Include these anti-inflammatory foods:
Fresh vegetables
(all kinds) – Aim for a variety of types and colours (a rainbow of veggies provides phytonutrients) with a minimum of four to five servings per day – especially dark, leafy greens (spinach, kale, Asian greens) broccoli and cauliflower, brussel sprouts, beetroot
Whole pieces of fruit
(not juice that strips them of fibre) – three to four servings per day is a good amount for most people, especially berries and cherries
Fatty fish
– such as salmon, trout, sardines, mackerel & tuna
Herbs & spices
-turmeric, ginger, basil, oregano, thyme, cinnamon etc.,
Healthy fats
– extra virgin olive oil is the best option, avocado oil and the fats found in seeds, nuts, fish
Nuts/seeds
– such as walnuts, cashews, almonds, pistachios, pine nuts, chia, hemp
Whole grains –
brown rice, amaranth, buckwheat, and quinoa
Legumes/beans
– especially black beans, black-eyed peas, chickpeas, lentils, red kidney
Drinks
– water, green tea and organic coffee in moderation
Nightshades or not?
Eggplant, tomatoes, capsicum and potatoes – are central to Mediterranean cuisine. Some people believe they trigger arthritis flares, but there’s limited scientific evidence to support this theory. Some people may react as they have a food sensitivity to these vegetables. If you react consider replacing these vegetables with sweet potatoes, cauliflower or mushrooms.
The Mediterranean Diet is considered one of the healthiest diets and is also a good go-to for an anti-inflammatory diet. It also includes dairy such as yoghurt and cheese, good for calcium intake to prevent osteoporosis.
Avoid these inflammatory / processed foods
Processed meats
– sausages and cold cut meats – ham, salami etc.
Refined sugars
– found in soft drinks, cookies, cake, lollies, ice cream, some breakfast cereals
Trans fats
– found in deep fried foods, fast foods, commercially baked goods
Processed snack foods
– such as chips and crackers
Gluten, white bread & pasta
& too many carbohydrates
Soybean oil and vegetable oil
Alcohol
in excessive quantities

How bad diets around the world have led to 11 million deaths

Nightshades or not?
-------------------
Eggplant, tomatoes, capsicum and potatoes – are central to Mediterranean cuisine. Some people believe they trigger arthritis flares, but there’s limited scientific evidence to support this theory. Some people may react as they have a food sensitivity to these vegetables. If you react consider replacing these vegetables with sweet potatoes, cauliflower or mushrooms.
The Mediterranean Diet is considered one of the healthiest diets and is also a good go-to for an anti-inflammatory diet. It also includes dairy such as yoghurt and cheese, good for calcium intake to prevent osteoporosis.
Avoid these inflammatory / processed foods
Processed meats
– sausages and cold cut meats – ham, salami etc.
Refined sugars
– found in soft drinks, cookies, cake, lollies, ice cream, some breakfast cereals
Trans fats
– found in deep fried foods, fast foods, commercially baked goods
Processed snack foods
– such as chips and crackers
Gluten, white bread & pasta
& too many carbohydrates
Soybean oil and vegetable oil
Alcohol
in excessive quantities

An update on ultra-processed food & poor health
Firstly what is processed food?
“Processed food” includes food that has been cooked, canned, frozen, packaged or changed in nutritional composition with fortifying, preserving or preparing in different ways. That is, packaged food that is no longer in its natural state.
Recent studies have found that a diet of ultra-processed food was associated with higher rates of disease and poor health. We know that ultra-processed foods tend to be higher in added sugar, salt and fat making them unhealthy. However, even if they have added nutrients, the evidence suggests that because they’re ultra-processed it doesn’t matter what we add to their nutrient content, it’s not going to make them a healthy option.
A recent study based in France, found increasing the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet by 10 per cent was associated with significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke). Another study based in Spain, found people who consumed more than four servings of ultra-processed food per day were 62 per cent more likely to die of any cause compared to those who had less than two servings per day.
In both studies, large groups of adults completed food intake questionnaires, then their rates of disease were tracked for up to 10 years.
We might need to reconsider what it is about these foods that makes them unhealthy, said Professor Lawrence, a food policy expert from Deakin University.
“It’s not just about the so-called ‘risky’ nutrients in foods,” he said. “The nature of the cause is associated with the physical and chemical changes that happen to the food as a result of this high degree of industrial processing.”
The findings provide further weight to the already sizeable pile of evidence that highly processed food is linked to poorer health.
Easy food swaps & meal ideas
Breakfast
Instead of white bread (crumpets and English muffins), butter, jam, Nutella, processed breakfast cereals, pancakes and bacon, try:
Avocado, nut spread (not peanut), banana/cinnamon on rye bread
Have porridge (whole oats) & berries– sweeten with a small amount of maple syrup or honey
Organic scrambled / boiled eggs with herbs or turmeric
Avocado & smoked salmon on whole grain bread
Granola with Greek yoghurt and berries
Lunch
Instead of hot chips, frozen meals, white bread sandwiches (cold cuts), pasta/potato/Caesar salads try:
Vegetable frittata with salad
Salads with a variety of fruit and vegetables – also add brown rice, quinoa and nuts to be more filling – dress with oil and vinegar and spices (not store-bought dressings); replace lettuce with spinach
Salmon cakes & salad
Lettuce wraps with salmon or trout, herbs and carrot/cucumber
Dinner
Instead of pizza, pasta, hamburgers, red meat roasts try:
Try one-tray bakes with fish, lean chicken and veggies (less washing up!)
Have minestrone soup instead of pumpkin soup – use a variety of veggies & herbs – count how many colours and types you can get in one soup
Replace side serves of pasta, white rice and potatoes with more veggies, salad or whole grains
Grill fish and veggies on the BBQ and service with a salad
Asian soups with salmon and greens
Snacks
Instead of chips, biscuits, cakes, chocolate, try:
A handful of nuts – roast them or buy roasted for some extra crunch and flavour
Kale chips – kale, olive oil and a small sprinkle of salt & roast in the oven
Toasted pita spread, carrots, cucumber with hummus or avocado dip
Mixed berries and Greek yoghurt
Grab a piece of fruit
Drinks
Instead of soft drinks and excessive alcohol, try:
Water with a squeeze of citrus or flavoured with cut up fruit
Mineral water
Green tea and organic coffee in moderation
Extra Tips
Buy fruit and veggies that are in season for freshness and to save money
Prepare a shopping list and stick to it…if it’s not in the pantry you can’t eat it!
Have plenty of health snacks on hand
Ask a partner, family member or friend to buddy up with you – provide each other support, encouragement and give each other ideas/recipes
Limit the amount of take-away food
Try different recipes and get a collection of ones that you enjoy – everyone has different tastes. See

What is an anti-inflammatory diet?
----------------------------------
An anti-inflammatory diet involves eating nutrient-rich, whole foods that reduce inflammation in the body. It contains plenty of fibre, antioxidants, and omega-3s. This means a diet rich in vegetables, whole fruit, whole grains, legumes, and fatty fish – that is as unprocessed as possible.
Include these anti-inflammatory foods:
Fresh vegetables
(all kinds) – Aim for a variety of types and colours (a rainbow of veggies provides phytonutrients) with a minimum of four to five servings per day – especially dark, leafy greens (spinach, kale, Asian greens) broccoli and cauliflower, brussel sprouts, beetroot
Whole pieces of fruit
(not juice that strips them of fibre) – three to four servings per day is a good amount for most people, especially berries and cherries
Fatty fish
– such as salmon, trout, sardines, mackerel & tuna
Herbs & spices
-turmeric, ginger, basil, oregano, thyme, cinnamon etc.,
Healthy fats
– extra virgin olive oil is the best option, avocado oil and the fats found in seeds, nuts, fish
Nuts/seeds
– such as walnuts, cashews, almonds, pistachios, pine nuts, chia, hemp
Whole grains –
brown rice, amaranth, buckwheat, and quinoa
Legumes/beans
– especially black beans, black-eyed peas, chickpeas, lentils, red kidney
Drinks
– water, green tea and organic coffee in moderation
Nightshades or not?
Eggplant, tomatoes, capsicum and potatoes – are central to Mediterranean cuisine. Some people believe they trigger arthritis flares, but there’s limited scientific evidence to support this theory. Some people may react as they have a food sensitivity to these vegetables. If you react consider replacing these vegetables with sweet potatoes, cauliflower or mushrooms.
The Mediterranean Diet is considered one of the healthiest diets and is also a good go-to for an anti-inflammatory diet. It also includes dairy such as yoghurt and cheese, good for calcium intake to prevent osteoporosis.
Avoid these inflammatory / processed foods
Processed meats
– sausages and cold cut meats – ham, salami etc.
Refined sugars
– found in soft drinks, cookies, cake, lollies, ice cream, some breakfast cereals
Trans fats
– found in deep fried foods, fast foods, commercially baked goods
Processed snack foods
– such as chips and crackers
Gluten, white bread & pasta
& too many carbohydrates
Soybean oil and vegetable oil
Alcohol
in excessive quantities

An update on ultra-processed food & poor health
Firstly what is processed food?
“Processed food” includes food that has been cooked, canned, frozen, packaged or changed in nutritional composition with fortifying, preserving or preparing in different ways. That is, packaged food that is no longer in its natural state.
Recent studies have found that a diet of ultra-processed food was associated with higher rates of disease and poor health. We know that ultra-processed foods tend to be higher in added sugar, salt and fat making them unhealthy. However, even if they have added nutrients, the evidence suggests that because they’re ultra-processed it doesn’t matter what we add to their nutrient content, it’s not going to make them a healthy option.
A recent study based in France, found increasing the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet by 10 per cent was associated with significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke). Another study based in Spain, found people who consumed more than four servings of ultra-processed food per day were 62 per cent more likely to die of any cause compared to those who had less than two servings per day.
In both studies, large groups of adults completed food intake questionnaires, then their rates of disease were tracked for up to 10 years.
We might need to reconsider what it is about these foods that makes them unhealthy, said Professor Lawrence, a food policy expert from Deakin University.
“It’s not just about the so-called ‘risky’ nutrients in foods,” he said. “The nature of the cause is associated with the physical and chemical changes that happen to the food as a result of this high degree of industrial processing.”
The findings provide further weight to the already sizeable pile of evidence that highly processed food is linked to poorer health.
Easy food swaps & meal ideas
Breakfast
Instead of white bread (crumpets and English muffins), butter, jam, Nutella, processed breakfast cereals, pancakes and bacon, try:
Avocado, nut spread (not peanut), banana/cinnamon on rye bread
Have porridge (whole oats) & berries– sweeten with a small amount of maple syrup or honey
Organic scrambled / boiled eggs with herbs or turmeric
Avocado & smoked salmon on whole grain bread
Granola with Greek yoghurt and berries
Lunch
Instead of hot chips, frozen meals, white bread sandwiches (cold cuts), pasta/potato/Caesar salads try:
Vegetable frittata with salad
Salads with a variety of fruit and vegetables – also add brown rice, quinoa and nuts to be more filling – dress with oil and vinegar and spices (not store-bought dressings); replace lettuce with spinach
Salmon cakes & salad
Lettuce wraps with salmon or trout, herbs and carrot/cucumber
Dinner
Instead of pizza, pasta, hamburgers, red meat roasts try:
Try one-tray bakes with fish, lean chicken and veggies (less washing up!)
Have minestrone soup instead of pumpkin soup – use a variety of veggies & herbs – count how many colours and types you can get in one soup
Replace side serves of pasta, white rice and potatoes with more veggies, salad or whole grains
Grill fish and veggies on the BBQ and service with a salad
Asian soups with salmon and greens
Snacks
Instead of chips, biscuits, cakes, chocolate, try:
A handful of nuts – roast them or buy roasted for some extra crunch and flavour
Kale chips – kale, olive oil and a small sprinkle of salt & roast in the oven
Toasted pita spread, carrots, cucumber with hummus or avocado dip
Mixed berries and Greek yoghurt
Grab a piece of fruit
Drinks
Instead of soft drinks and excessive alcohol, try:
Water with a squeeze of citrus or flavoured with cut up fruit
Mineral water
Green tea and organic coffee in moderation
Extra Tips
Buy fruit and veggies that are in season for freshness and to save money
Prepare a shopping list and stick to it…if it’s not in the pantry you can’t eat it!
Have plenty of health snacks on hand
Ask a partner, family member or friend to buddy up with you – provide each other support, encouragement and give each other ideas/recipes
Limit the amount of take-away food
Try different recipes and get a collection of ones that you enjoy – everyone has different tastes. See
Sources and Further Reading
below for some recipes ideas and inspiration
Make large batches and freeze where you can, to have something on hand
Be organised, plan your meals and it will then become easier as you go along
Give yourself an occasional treat, rather than stop trying all together!
We hope that you enjoy the great feeling and health outcomes from eating nutrient-rich, whole foods.
Please note!
If you need help from a health professional to get you started or think you have some food allergies or sensitivities, you may want to see a Dietician.

An update on ultra-processed food & poor health
Firstly what is processed food?
“Processed food” includes food that has been cooked, canned, frozen, packaged or changed in nutritional composition with fortifying, preserving or preparing in different ways. That is, packaged food that is no longer in its natural state.
Recent studies have found that a diet of ultra-processed food was associated with higher rates of disease and poor health. We know that ultra-processed foods tend to be higher in added sugar, salt and fat making them unhealthy. However, even if they have added nutrients, the evidence suggests that because they’re ultra-processed it doesn’t matter what we add to their nutrient content, it’s not going to make them a healthy option.
A recent study based in France, found increasing the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet by 10 per cent was associated with significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke). Another study based in Spain, found people who consumed more than four servings of ultra-processed food per day were 62 per cent more likely to die of any cause compared to those who had less than two servings per day.
In both studies, large groups of adults completed food intake questionnaires, then their rates of disease were tracked for up to 10 years.
We might need to reconsider what it is about these foods that makes them unhealthy, said Professor Lawrence, a food policy expert from Deakin University.
“It’s not just about the so-called ‘risky’ nutrients in foods,” he said. “The nature of the cause is associated with the physical and chemical changes that happen to the food as a result of this high degree of industrial processing.”
The findings provide further weight to the already sizeable pile of evidence that highly processed food is linked to poorer health.
Easy food swaps & meal ideas
Breakfast
Instead of white bread (crumpets and English muffins), butter, jam, Nutella, processed breakfast cereals, pancakes and bacon, try:
Avocado, nut spread (not peanut), banana/cinnamon on rye bread
Have porridge (whole oats) & berries– sweeten with a small amount of maple syrup or honey
Organic scrambled / boiled eggs with herbs or turmeric
Avocado & smoked salmon on whole grain bread
Granola with Greek yoghurt and berries
Lunch
Instead of hot chips, frozen meals, white bread sandwiches (cold cuts), pasta/potato/Caesar salads try:
Vegetable frittata with salad
Salads with a variety of fruit and vegetables – also add brown rice, quinoa and nuts to be more filling – dress with oil and vinegar and spices (not store-bought dressings); replace lettuce with spinach
Salmon cakes & salad
Lettuce wraps with salmon or trout, herbs and carrot/cucumber
Dinner
Instead of pizza, pasta, hamburgers, red meat roasts try:
Try one-tray bakes with fish, lean chicken and veggies (less washing up!)
Have minestrone soup instead of pumpkin soup – use a variety of veggies & herbs – count how many colours and types you can get in one soup
Replace side serves of pasta, white rice and potatoes with more veggies, salad or whole grains
Grill fish and veggies on the BBQ and service with a salad
Asian soups with salmon and greens
Snacks
Instead of chips, biscuits, cakes, chocolate, try:
A handful of nuts – roast them or buy roasted for some extra crunch and flavour
Kale chips – kale, olive oil and a small sprinkle of salt & roast in the oven
Toasted pita spread, carrots, cucumber with hummus or avocado dip
Mixed berries and Greek yoghurt
Grab a piece of fruit
Drinks
Instead of soft drinks and excessive alcohol, try:
Water with a squeeze of citrus or flavoured with cut up fruit
Mineral water
Green tea and organic coffee in moderation
Extra Tips
Buy fruit and veggies that are in season for freshness and to save money
Prepare a shopping list and stick to it…if it’s not in the pantry you can’t eat it!
Have plenty of health snacks on hand
Ask a partner, family member or friend to buddy up with you – provide each other support, encouragement and give each other ideas/recipes
Limit the amount of take-away food
Try different recipes and get a collection of ones that you enjoy – everyone has different tastes. See

below for some recipes ideas and inspiration
Make large batches and freeze where you can, to have something on hand
Be organised, plan your meals and it will then become easier as you go along
Give yourself an occasional treat, rather than stop trying all together!
We hope that you enjoy the great feeling and health outcomes from eating nutrient-rich, whole foods.
Please note!
If you need help from a health professional to get you started or think you have some food allergies or sensitivities, you may want to see a Dietician.

Following an anti-inflammatory diet will not cure arthritis, however for many people it is an effective way of controlling symptoms, maintaining a healthy weight and reducing the risk of developing other health problems.  Recent studies have also found that a diet high in ultra-processed food (one of the things to avoid in an anti-Inflammatory diet) was associated with higher rates of disease and mortality.
So what is an anti-inflammatory diet and how can you incorporate it into your life?
Read on!
An anti-inflammatory diet involves eating nutrient-rich, whole foods that reduce inflammation in the body. It contains plenty of fibre, antioxidants, and omega-3s. This means a diet rich in vegetables, whole fruit, whole grains, legumes, and fatty fish – that is as unprocessed as possible.
(all kinds) – Aim for a variety of types and colours (a rainbow of veggies provides phytonutrients) with a minimum of four to five servings per day – especially dark, leafy greens (spinach, kale, Asian greens) broccoli and cauliflower, brussel sprouts, beetroot
(not juice that strips them of fibre) – three to four servings per day is a good amount for most people, especially berries and cherries
– such as salmon, trout, sardines, mackerel & tuna
-turmeric, ginger, basil, oregano, thyme, cinnamon etc.,
– extra virgin olive oil is the best option, avocado oil and the fats found in seeds, nuts, fish
– such as walnuts, cashews, almonds, pistachios, pine nuts, chia, hemp
brown rice, amaranth, buckwheat, and quinoa
– especially black beans, black-eyed peas, chickpeas, lentils, red kidney
– water, green tea and organic coffee in moderation
Eggplant, tomatoes, capsicum and potatoes – are central to Mediterranean cuisine. Some people believe they trigger arthritis flares, but there’s limited scientific evidence to support this theory. Some people may react as they have a food sensitivity to these vegetables. If you react consider replacing these vegetables with sweet potatoes, cauliflower or mushrooms.
The Mediterranean Diet is considered one of the healthiest diets and is also a good go-to for an anti-inflammatory diet. It also includes dairy such as yoghurt and cheese, good for calcium intake to prevent osteoporosis.
– sausages and cold cut meats – ham, salami etc.
– found in soft drinks, cookies, cake, lollies, ice cream, some breakfast cereals
– found in deep fried foods, fast foods, commercially baked goods
– such as chips and crackers
& too many carbohydrates
in excessive quantities

Salads with a variety of fruit and vegetables – also add brown rice, quinoa and nuts to be more filling – dress with oil and vinegar and spices (not store-bought dressings); replace lettuce with spinach
Salmon cakes & salad
Lettuce wraps with salmon or trout, herbs and carrot/cucumber
Instead of pizza, pasta, hamburgers, red meat roasts try:
Try one-tray bakes with fish, lean chicken and veggies (less washing up!)
Have minestrone soup instead of pumpkin soup – use a variety of veggies & herbs – count how many colours and types you can get in one soup
Replace side serves of pasta, white rice and potatoes with more veggies, salad or whole grains
Grill fish and veggies on the BBQ and service with a salad
Asian soups with salmon and greens
Instead of chips, biscuits, cakes, chocolate, try:
A handful of nuts – roast them or buy roasted for some extra crunch and flavour
Kale chips – kale, olive oil and a small sprinkle of salt & roast in the oven
Toasted pita spread, carrots, cucumber with hummus or avocado dip
Mixed berries and Greek yoghurt
Grab a piece of fruit
Instead of soft drinks and excessive alcohol, try:
Water with a squeeze of citrus or flavoured with cut up fruit
Mineral water
Green tea and organic coffee in moderation
Buy fruit and veggies that are in season for freshness and to save money
Prepare a shopping list and stick to it…if it’s not in the pantry you can’t eat it!
Have plenty of health snacks on hand
Ask a partner, family member or friend to buddy up with you – provide each other support, encouragement and give each other ideas/recipes
Limit the amount of take-away food
Try different recipes and get a collection of ones that you enjoy – everyone has different tastes. See
below for some recipes ideas and inspiration
Make large batches and freeze where you can, to have something on hand
Be organised, plan your meals and it will then become easier as you go along
Give yourself an occasional treat, rather than stop trying all together!
We hope that you enjoy the great feeling and health outcomes from eating nutrient-rich, whole foods.

Following an anti-inflammatory diet will not cure arthritis, however for many people it is an effective way of controlling symptoms, maintaining a healthy weight and reducing the risk of developing other health problems.  Recent studies have also found that a diet high in ultra-processed food (one of the things to avoid in an anti-Inflammatory diet) was associated with higher rates of disease and mortality.
So what is an anti-inflammatory diet and how can you incorporate it into your life?
Read on!
An anti-inflammatory diet involves eating nutrient-rich, whole foods that reduce inflammation in the body. It contains plenty of fibre, antioxidants, and omega-3s. This means a diet rich in vegetables, whole fruit, whole grains, legumes, and fatty fish – that is as unprocessed as possible.
(all kinds) – Aim for a variety of types and colours (a rainbow of veggies provides phytonutrients) with a minimum of four to five servings per day – especially dark, leafy greens (spinach, kale, Asian greens) broccoli and cauliflower, brussel sprouts, beetroot
(not juice that strips them of fibre) – three to four servings per day is a good amount for most people, especially berries and cherries
– such as salmon, trout, sardines, mackerel & tuna
-turmeric, ginger, basil, oregano, thyme, cinnamon etc.,
– extra virgin olive oil is the best option, avocado oil and the fats found in seeds, nuts, fish
– such as walnuts, cashews, almonds, pistachios, pine nuts, chia, hemp
brown rice, amaranth, buckwheat, and quinoa
– especially black beans, black-eyed peas, chickpeas, lentils, red kidney
– water, green tea and organic coffee in moderation
Eggplant, tomatoes, capsicum and potatoes – are central to Mediterranean cuisine. Some people believe they trigger arthritis flares, but there’s limited scientific evidence to support this theory. Some people may react as they have a food sensitivity to these vegetables. If you react consider replacing these vegetables with sweet potatoes, cauliflower or mushrooms.
The Mediterranean Diet is considered one of the healthiest diets and is also a good go-to for an anti-inflammatory diet. It also includes dairy such as yoghurt and cheese, good for calcium intake to prevent osteoporosis.
– sausages and cold cut meats – ham, salami etc.
– found in soft drinks, cookies, cake, lollies, ice cream, some breakfast cereals
– found in deep fried foods, fast foods, commercially baked goods
– such as chips and crackers
& too many carbohydrates
in excessive quantities
Firstly what is processed food?
“Processed food” includes food that has been cooked, canned, frozen, packaged or changed in nutritional composition with fortifying, preserving or preparing in different ways. That is, packaged food that is no longer in its natural state.
Recent studies have found that a diet of ultra-processed food was associated with higher rates of disease and poor health. We know that ultra-processed foods tend to be higher in added sugar, salt and fat making them unhealthy. However, even if they have added nutrients, the evidence suggests that because they’re ultra-processed it doesn’t matter what we add to their nutrient content, it’s not going to make them a healthy option.
A recent study based in France, found increasing the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet by 10 per cent was associated with significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke). Another study based in Spain, found people who consumed more than four servings of ultra-processed food per day were 62 per cent more likely to die of any cause compared to those who had less than two servings per day.
In both studies, large groups of adults completed food intake questionnaires, then their rates of disease were tracked for up to 10 years.
We might need to reconsider what it is about these foods that makes them unhealthy, said Professor Lawrence, a food policy expert from Deakin University.
“It’s not just about the so-called ‘risky’ nutrients in foods,” he said. “The nature of the cause is associated with the physical and chemical changes that happen to the food as a result of this high degree of industrial processing.”
The findings provide further weight to the already sizeable pile of evidence that highly processed food is linked to poorer health.
Instead of white bread (crumpets and English muffins), butter, jam, Nutella, processed breakfast cereals, pancakes and bacon, try:
Avocado, nut spread (not peanut), banana/cinnamon on rye bread
Have porridge (whole oats) & berries– sweeten with a small amount of maple syrup or honey
Organic scrambled / boiled eggs with herbs or turmeric
Avocado & smoked salmon on whole grain bread
Granola with Greek yoghurt and berries
