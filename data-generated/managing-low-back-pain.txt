Low back pain is a significant burden in terms of pain, disability and loss of quality of life for those who experience it. This is a global problem with data in Australia revealing that a quarter of the population may have it at any one time. The fiscal burden is reported to be about $5 billion a year of direct costs.
Developed by Arthritis Australia in conjunction with expert researchers, health professionals and people with back pain; the website provides trustworthy and up-to-date information on managing your low back pain. It also has a quiz plus a series of videos to help you learn more.
The Agency for Clinical Innovation released a consumer guide in 2019 which outlines the ACI  Musculoskeletal Network best practice care as well as frequently asked questions, a case study, common back pain myths and a personalised care plan for you to complete.
Many people believe that if they are in pain they need a scan (an X-ray, CT or CAT scan or MRI scan), but actually this isn’t true. Learn why scans are often unnecessary, and how staying active can help you recover faster.

Low back pain is a significant burden in terms of pain, disability and loss of quality of life for those who experience it. This is a global problem with data in Australia revealing that a quarter of the population may have it at any one time. The fiscal burden is reported to be about $5 billion a year of direct costs.
Developed by Arthritis Australia in conjunction with expert researchers, health professionals and people with back pain; the website provides trustworthy and up-to-date information on managing your low back pain. It also has a quiz plus a series of videos to help you learn more.
The Agency for Clinical Innovation released a consumer guide in 2019 which outlines the ACI  Musculoskeletal Network best practice care as well as frequently asked questions, a case study, common back pain myths and a personalised care plan for you to complete.
Many people believe that if they are in pain they need a scan (an X-ray, CT or CAT scan or MRI scan), but actually this isn’t true. Learn why scans are often unnecessary, and how staying active can help you recover faster.
