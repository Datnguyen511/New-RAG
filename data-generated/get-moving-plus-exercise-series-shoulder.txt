if you have any questions about the exercises included in the e-booklet.
There is a range of exercises included for shoulder related musculoskeletal conditions (including arthritis). These exercises can be used for a variety of conditions including, but not limited to, shoulder arthritis, “frozen” shoulder or capsulitis, scapulothoracic issues, pain, muscle weakness, and rehabilitation from different types of shoulder surgeries. Please talk to your surgeon, physiotherapist or exercise physiologist for guidance on which exercises may be best suited to you, your particular condition, and/or for more challenging and advanced options. Many of the exercises included require movement of the middle spine (thoracic) area. You may find it beneficial to include some spinal movement exercises from Spine Get Moving! PLUS, particularly spinal extension and rotation exercises.
General exercise parameters
As these are general guidelines, please consult with your allied healthcare professional for individual prescription.
When performing a mobility exercise, try performing 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps (or as otherwise prescribed). Initially,  you may find you can only perform one set or only 5 repetitions and that’s ok. Slowly and progressively build the number of sets and reps.
For exercises where the position is held still, (a stretch or strength exercise) try performing 2–3 sets of 5sec holds, then 10sec, 20sec, 30sec and so on as you progressively increase time held and/or increase the set range or resistance (or as prescribed).
When moving in and out of joint range e.g., self-assisted knee flexion or ankle dorsiflexion, do so with control and with equal speed. Build up to perform 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps (or as otherwise prescribed).
Keep a normal steady breath throughout the exercises. Try not to hold your breath excessively while exercising.
Please note:
your doctor/surgeon or physiotherapist may not want you moving a recently surgery or reconstructed joint in a certain direction, degree and/or with force/resistance. If you are unsure about what mobility exercises to do and how to perform them safely, please do not attempt the exercise/s and ask for professional guidance first.
