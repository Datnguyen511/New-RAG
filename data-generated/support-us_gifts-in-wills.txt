If you are considering leaving us a gift in your Will – thank you! An increasing number of our supporters are choosing to remember our organisation in their Will – continuing to care for and help improve the lives of people suffering from arthritis and related musculoskeletal conditions. Any gift large or small makes a difference and we promise to use your gift carefully and wisely where it can have the greatest impact.
Considering your legacy is a very personal matter. Of course, you’ll want to think of your family and loved ones first. But you can also provide enduring support for the cause you believe in. And we would be truly honoured to be part of your legacy.
Q:
Do I need to change my will if I am leaving a gift/bequest to  Arthritis New South Wales?
No, any bequest left to Arthritis New South Wales will revert to The Arthritis Movement, so there’s no need to change your will. Going forward, if you are considering leaving a gift in your will, we would encourage you to name The Arthritis Movement.
It is very easy to leave Arthritis NSW a gift in your Will.
You will simply need the following information for your solicitor:
Arthritis NSW, Locked Bag 2216, North Ryde NSW 1670
CFN: 12845
ABN: 64 528 634 894
The most usual gifts are:
A sum of money, which can be any sum of money that suits your circumstances, often called a pecuniary gift.
A percentage of the value of your estate – this is formally called a residuary gift. It can be from 1% to 100% of your estate – whatever suits your own circumstances. By leaving a gift of even 1% in your Will, after you’ve taken care of loved ones can change the lives of those living with arthritis.
If you would like more information, please call our Philanthropy Manager, Nick Cadey on 02 9857 3300 for a confidential discussion, or email Nick at
