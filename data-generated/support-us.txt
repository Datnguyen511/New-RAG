Nearly four million Australians of all ages are affected by arthritis, and this number is expected to almost double by 2050. It is the most significant cause of pain and disability in Australia, forcing many to take early retirement, at significant financial, social and emotional cost.
We offer education, support and health services to empower people suffering from arthritis to improve the quality of their lives. These include the Arthritis Infoline, camps for children with juvenile arthritis and their families, Rural Health Program, publications, educational events, gentle-exercise classes and public awareness campaigns. Your support will go towards delivery of these services and development of new programs.
Whether you choose to make a once-off donation, become a regular giver, support our work through a corporate partnership, or leave a gift in your Will, your contribution will be greatly appreciated by the people we support.
You can make a difference by supporting the work of The Arthritis Movement (Arthritis NSW).
Arthritis NSW and Arthritis Queensland are Members of The Arthritis Movement. Please note that there will be a transition period while our financial and administrative structures are finalised. During this time, we ask that you still donate and make other payments to Arthritis Queensland or Arthritis NSW depending on which state you reside in, which will continue to issue receipts.
