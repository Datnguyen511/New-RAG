What is Warm Water Exercise?
Exercising in
warm water
is one of the most comfortable and effective ways that a person with arthritis can exercise. The buoyancy of the water supports the body, taking the weight off inflamed and painful joints. The warmth of the water helps tight joints to loosen up and relax, easing soreness and soothing any pain.
The role of the water in your exercise class is two-fold – not only does it soothe and support your body, it also offers resistance to your movements, acting  somewhat like a weight to help strengthen your muscles while you exercise.
How can it help me?
Keep you moving
Improve your coordination and endurance
Ease stiff joints and relax sore muscles
Help you feel better
Our warm water exercise classes
Our program is facilitated specifically for people affected by arthritis. All classes are lead by trained health professionals, with the minimum qualification being a Fitness Certificate IV covering hydrotherapy. A number of classes are run by physiotherapists and are eligible for health fund claim receipts. Our classes:
give you the opportunity to exercise with guidance from a trained instructor, in a friendly and social environment
are designed for small groups
participants follow the same routine, but your leader will show you how to adjust the exercise to fit your personal needs, such as varying the pressure you exert on the water.
What people have said
“I will be continuing the hydro as it has help my management of my pain and slowly building my muscles, I managed to get in and out of the bath which I haven’t been able to for 6 years.”
“I believe the warm water exercises are good for my arthritis. I get a wonderful feeling when I enter the warm pool. I enjoy the company of the other participants and we share our ups and downs. We have lunch afterwards and that is good for our morale.  Friendships are made.”
“The warm water class lifts my mood and keeps me motivated to pursue further exercise.”
“I attend warm water classes and Strength and Balance regularly and it has helped my Arthritis (knee) immensely. I’m managing a quality lifestyle doing what I like to do with these regular exercises without undergoing surgery. I will recommend these efforts by Arthritis NSW to anyone who needs it without hesitation.”

What is Warm Water Exercise?
----------------------------
Exercising in
warm water
is one of the most comfortable and effective ways that a person with arthritis can exercise. The buoyancy of the water supports the body, taking the weight off inflamed and painful joints. The warmth of the water helps tight joints to loosen up and relax, easing soreness and soothing any pain.
The role of the water in your exercise class is two-fold – not only does it soothe and support your body, it also offers resistance to your movements, acting  somewhat like a weight to help strengthen your muscles while you exercise.
How can it help me?
Keep you moving
Improve your coordination and endurance
Ease stiff joints and relax sore muscles
Help you feel better
Our warm water exercise classes
Our program is facilitated specifically for people affected by arthritis. All classes are lead by trained health professionals, with the minimum qualification being a Fitness Certificate IV covering hydrotherapy. A number of classes are run by physiotherapists and are eligible for health fund claim receipts. Our classes:
give you the opportunity to exercise with guidance from a trained instructor, in a friendly and social environment
are designed for small groups
participants follow the same routine, but your leader will show you how to adjust the exercise to fit your personal needs, such as varying the pressure you exert on the water.
What people have said
“I will be continuing the hydro as it has help my management of my pain and slowly building my muscles, I managed to get in and out of the bath which I haven’t been able to for 6 years.”
“I believe the warm water exercises are good for my arthritis. I get a wonderful feeling when I enter the warm pool. I enjoy the company of the other participants and we share our ups and downs. We have lunch afterwards and that is good for our morale.  Friendships are made.”
“The warm water class lifts my mood and keeps me motivated to pursue further exercise.”
“I attend warm water classes and Strength and Balance regularly and it has helped my Arthritis (knee) immensely. I’m managing a quality lifestyle doing what I like to do with these regular exercises without undergoing surgery. I will recommend these efforts by Arthritis NSW to anyone who needs it without hesitation.”

What is Warm Water Exercise?
----------------------------
Exercising in
warm water
is one of the most comfortable and effective ways that a person with arthritis can exercise. The buoyancy of the water supports the body, taking the weight off inflamed and painful joints. The warmth of the water helps tight joints to loosen up and relax, easing soreness and soothing any pain.
The role of the water in your exercise class is two-fold – not only does it soothe and support your body, it also offers resistance to your movements, acting  somewhat like a weight to help strengthen your muscles while you exercise.
How can it help me?
Keep you moving
Improve your coordination and endurance
Ease stiff joints and relax sore muscles
Help you feel better
Our warm water exercise classes
Our program is facilitated specifically for people affected by arthritis. All classes are lead by trained health professionals, with the minimum qualification being a Fitness Certificate IV covering hydrotherapy. A number of classes are run by physiotherapists and are eligible for health fund claim receipts. Our classes:
give you the opportunity to exercise with guidance from a trained instructor, in a friendly and social environment
are designed for small groups
participants follow the same routine, but your leader will show you how to adjust the exercise to fit your personal needs, such as varying the pressure you exert on the water.
What people have said
“I will be continuing the hydro as it has help my management of my pain and slowly building my muscles, I managed to get in and out of the bath which I haven’t been able to for 6 years.”
“I believe the warm water exercises are good for my arthritis. I get a wonderful feeling when I enter the warm pool. I enjoy the company of the other participants and we share our ups and downs. We have lunch afterwards and that is good for our morale.  Friendships are made.”
“The warm water class lifts my mood and keeps me motivated to pursue further exercise.”
“I attend warm water classes and Strength and Balance regularly and it has helped my Arthritis (knee) immensely. I’m managing a quality lifestyle doing what I like to do with these regular exercises without undergoing surgery. I will recommend these efforts by Arthritis NSW to anyone who needs it without hesitation.”

Our warm water exercise classes
Our program is facilitated specifically for people affected by arthritis. All classes are lead by trained health professionals, with the minimum qualification being a Fitness Certificate IV covering hydrotherapy. A number of classes are run by physiotherapists and are eligible for health fund claim receipts. Our classes:
give you the opportunity to exercise with guidance from a trained instructor, in a friendly and social environment
are designed for small groups
participants follow the same routine, but your leader will show you how to adjust the exercise to fit your personal needs, such as varying the pressure you exert on the water.
What people have said
“I will be continuing the hydro as it has help my management of my pain and slowly building my muscles, I managed to get in and out of the bath which I haven’t been able to for 6 years.”
“I believe the warm water exercises are good for my arthritis. I get a wonderful feeling when I enter the warm pool. I enjoy the company of the other participants and we share our ups and downs. We have lunch afterwards and that is good for our morale.  Friendships are made.”
“The warm water class lifts my mood and keeps me motivated to pursue further exercise.”
“I attend warm water classes and Strength and Balance regularly and it has helped my Arthritis (knee) immensely. I’m managing a quality lifestyle doing what I like to do with these regular exercises without undergoing surgery. I will recommend these efforts by Arthritis NSW to anyone who needs it without hesitation.”

Exercising in
is one of the most comfortable and effective ways that a person with arthritis can exercise. The buoyancy of the water supports the body, taking the weight off inflamed and painful joints. The warmth of the water helps tight joints to loosen up and relax, easing soreness and soothing any pain.
The role of the water in your exercise class is two-fold – not only does it soothe and support your body, it also offers resistance to your movements, acting  somewhat like a weight to help strengthen your muscles while you exercise.
Keep you moving
Improve your coordination and endurance
Ease stiff joints and relax sore muscles
Help you feel better
Our program is facilitated specifically for people affected by arthritis. All classes are lead by trained health professionals, with the minimum qualification being a Fitness Certificate IV covering hydrotherapy. A number of classes are run by physiotherapists and are eligible for health fund claim receipts. Our classes:
give you the opportunity to exercise with guidance from a trained instructor, in a friendly and social environment
are designed for small groups
participants follow the same routine, but your leader will show you how to adjust the exercise to fit your personal needs, such as varying the pressure you exert on the water.

Shellharbour and Bald Hills – $150

Exercising in
is one of the most comfortable and effective ways that a person with arthritis can exercise. The buoyancy of the water supports the body, taking the weight off inflamed and painful joints. The warmth of the water helps tight joints to loosen up and relax, easing soreness and soothing any pain.
The role of the water in your exercise class is two-fold – not only does it soothe and support your body, it also offers resistance to your movements, acting  somewhat like a weight to help strengthen your muscles while you exercise.
Keep you moving
Improve your coordination and endurance
Ease stiff joints and relax sore muscles
Help you feel better
Our program is facilitated specifically for people affected by arthritis. All classes are lead by trained health professionals, with the minimum qualification being a Fitness Certificate IV covering hydrotherapy. A number of classes are run by physiotherapists and are eligible for health fund claim receipts. Our classes:
give you the opportunity to exercise with guidance from a trained instructor, in a friendly and social environment
are designed for small groups
participants follow the same routine, but your leader will show you how to adjust the exercise to fit your personal needs, such as varying the pressure you exert on the water.
