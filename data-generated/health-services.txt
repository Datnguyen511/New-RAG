How can we help?
----------------
We’re here to help, support and empower people with arthritis and related conditions. We are accessible to all people, from the newly diagnosed to those who have lived with the disease for some time.
We achieve this through the delivery of education programs covering topics such as lifestyle and nutrition, and health services which focus on self-management and gentle exercise.
The outcomes we seek for the people we help are improved or maintained joint functionality, reduced overall pain, and an improvement in quality of life.
Our key focus areas:
Prevention of disease
Management of conditions
Understanding and support
Research towards improved treatments
