Arthritis Assist: FAQs
----------------------
Background
What is peer support?
The Peers for Progress Model describes peer support as “practical, social, emotional, ongoing support from a person who shares similar experiences with a disease or health problem.”
Arthritis Assist Peer-Mentors provide support to people in NSW living with arthritis through active listening, sharing personal experiences, and by helping to find and access suitable information and services to support living well with arthritis.
How is the program funded?
Arthritis Assist is funded through the generous support of Arthritis NSW’s donors.
How it works
How does Arthritis Assist work?
When you register your interest in speaking with a Peer-Mentor, we’ll ask you to complete a few questions to tell us a little about yourself. We then use this information to match you with one of our trained Peer-Mentors that closely shares similarities with you.
Your Peer-Mentor will give you a call at a time that best suits you. They’ll get to know you a little and listen to what you’re going through.
Everyone’s situation is different, and so is their support needs. Peer-Mentors tailor their support to each person they speak with. They may share their own experiences and tips, help to answer your questions, assist you in setting goals or taking actionable steps to take control of your arthritis. Or, they may simply just listen.
You can organise up to 6 initial calls with your Peer-Mentor.
How will I be matched with a Peer-Mentor?

While we do our best when finding your Peer-Mentor match, we understand that sometimes the connection might just not be right. If this is the case, we’ll match you to a new Peer-Mentor.
How long is the program?
You can organise up to 6 initial calls with your Peer-Mentor. The length of each call is up to you and your peer-mentor.
How many sessions can I access?
You can organise up to 6 initial calls with your Peer-Mentor. If you would like further calls, Arthritis NSW staff will first of all check in with you and your Peer-Mentor after the sixth call.
Can someone else sit in on the call with me?
Some people may like to have a partner, family member or close friend join them in a conversation with their Peer-Mentor. Peer-Mentors should be made aware of anyone else intending to join a call and decide if they are comfortable with this before continuing.

The Peers for Progress Model describes peer support as “practical, social, emotional, ongoing support from a person who shares similar experiences with a disease or health problem.”
Arthritis Assist Peer-Mentors provide support to people in NSW living with arthritis through active listening, sharing personal experiences, and by helping to find and access suitable information and services to support living well with arthritis.
Arthritis Assist is funded through the generous support of Arthritis NSW’s donors.
When you register your interest in speaking with a Peer-Mentor, we’ll ask you to complete a few questions to tell us a little about yourself. We then use this information to match you with one of our trained Peer-Mentors that closely shares similarities with you.
Your Peer-Mentor will give you a call at a time that best suits you. They’ll get to know you a little and listen to what you’re going through.
Everyone’s situation is different, and so is their support needs. Peer-Mentors tailor their support to each person they speak with. They may share their own experiences and tips, help to answer your questions, assist you in setting goals or taking actionable steps to take control of your arthritis. Or, they may simply just listen.
You can organise up to 6 initial calls with your Peer-Mentor.
