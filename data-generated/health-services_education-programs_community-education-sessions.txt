Community Education Sessions
----------------------------
What are the community education programs
For people living with a chronic health condition such as arthritis, the health system can seem impersonal and impractical. An inhibiting factor to patients feeling involved in their own health care is the prevailing medical model that sees the patient as a passive recipient of treatment and advice. The clinical nature of medical care doesn’t take sufficient account of how people live their lives or how they’d like to. The focus is on managing disease, not promoting well-being. Community-based education programs play an important role in promoting the effective self-management of chronic health conditions such as arthritis.
How can it help me
When delivered by a trusted organisation, there are multiple benefits for participants:
a better understanding of their disease – the causes and affects
knowledge about self-managements strategies
skills and tips on how to implement self-management strategies
opportunities for peer education and support
ability to connect with the health-trained facilitator for further referral
evidence-based and consumer friendly information resources for ongoing reference
confidence and motivation to initiate beneficial lifestyle change.
