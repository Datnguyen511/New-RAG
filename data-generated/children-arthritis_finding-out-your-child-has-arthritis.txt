Finding out your child has arthritis
------------------------------------
Finding out that your child has arthritis can be a confusing and anxious time.
Your child’s diagnosis may have come as a huge shock, or perhaps it has been a long, difficult journey to find out the cause of their symptoms. A child being diagnosed with arthritis was never part of a family’s plans. The condition not only impacts the child with arthritis, but also parents, siblings and extended family members.
You will undoubtedly have lots of questions about what this means for your child, your family and the future.
In Australia, the types of arthritis that affect children are commonly referred to as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA for short).
The booklet
Finding out your child has arthritis
has been produced for parents, families and carers of children with JIA to answer some of the questions that other parents of children with JIA have struggled with, such as:
What JIA is, the different types and how your child may be affected
How JIA is diagnosed
Treatments for JIA
What you need to know about your child’s medicines
How to help your child manage pain
Keeping your child physically active
Staying healthy – sleep, rest, healthy eating
Managing school
Preparing for your child’s appointments
Helping your child to cope with the emotional impacts of arthritis
Teenagers and arthritis
Caring for the whole family.
With accurate early diagnosis and treatment, and advice from a supportive health care team, going to school, playing sport, being with friends, learning a musical instrument, and holidaying with the family should still be part of normal life for children with JIA.
