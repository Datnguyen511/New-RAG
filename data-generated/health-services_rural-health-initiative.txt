Since 2018, Arthritis NSW has proudly hosted community education seminars throughout New South Wales, empowering individuals to take charge of their health.

These events are all about equipping you with practical tools to manage your pain and enhance your quality of life. We’ll explore valuable strategies in exercise, nutrition, and mental health – all designed to help you live well with arthritis. Plus, enjoy a delightful afternoon tea with tasty nibbles and beverages, and take advantage of the opportunity to ask any questions you may have about managing your arthritis.
The seminars are completely free, and while we appreciate a gold coin donation to help us keep this important program running, your presence is what matters most!
Our informative sessions are co-facilitated with local community organisations, ensuring each event is tailored to meet your needs, all under the theme of Living Well with Arthritis. The program will cover:
