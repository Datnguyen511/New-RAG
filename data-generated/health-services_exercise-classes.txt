Exercising with arthritis
Staying physically active is important for everyone, whether or not you have arthritis. The benefits range from helping you to maintain a healthy weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol level, through to feeling more energetic and positive about life.
For people affected by arthritis, exercise is beneficial in pain-management, prompting your body to produce more of the natural feel-good hormones that help to dampen pain.
Regular exercise and stretching relieves joint stiffness, helping to maintain the joint’s optimal range of motion.
The strength and flexibility of muscles around your joints are improved with exercise, relieving some of the pressure on the joint itself and easing pain and inflammation.
Staying active boosts the production of the fluid inside your joints which keeps them lubricated, acting as a buffer against injury.
As well as keeping bones and muscles strong, exercise helps to improve your balance and prevent injury-inducing falls.
