Arthritis Statistics
--------------------
3.9 million Australians have arthritis. That’s 1 in 6 people.
By 2030, it is projected there will be 5.4 million Australians with arthritis.
Around 2 million people with arthritis are of working age (15-64 years)
Arthritis cost the health system $5.5 billion in 2015. This will rise to $7.6 billion by 2030.
Arthritis accounts for 8% of the total burden of disease and injury in Australia
Children get arthritis too
Arthritis is the leading cause of chronic pain and the second most common cause of disability and early retirement due to ill health in Australia.
52,000 people (aged 15-64 years) unable to work due to arthritis
Extra welfare costs and lost tax revenue due to early retirement due to arthritis cost $1.1 billion in 2015
There are more than 100 different types of arthritis
Most forms of arthritis are thought to be auto-immune conditions, where the body’s immune system attacks its own joint tissues
Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout are the most common forms of arthritis
We do know you’ve got to move it or lose it; rest can make pain and other symptoms much worse.
There’s no cure… yet, but there’s a lot that can be done and with your help we can make life for people with arthritis a whole lot better!
