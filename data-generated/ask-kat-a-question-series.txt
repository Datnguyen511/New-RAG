.
Here’s our previous questions answered:
Chinese Medicine
Is Chinese medicine safe to use in the treatment of arthritis?
Your Specialist
How do I talk to my specialist about getting scans or x-rays to establish exactly how much damage has been done?
Inflammation
I have both Ankylosing Spondylitis and Osteoarthritis, and so I was wondering if there were ways or things I could do to reduce inflammation to help treat my arthritis.
Pain Control
Non-Addictive pain control: what works best? This is a question asked by someone who attended one of our free Community Education webinars.
Children & Arthritis
How can I help support the mental and emotional health of my child with JIA?
The Festive season
It’s beginning to feel a lot like Christmas! All I hear about at this time of year is what not to do and what not to eat. What are the things I can do to ensure I have a good time and promote a sense of well-being over the holiday period?
Hand arthritis
I have arthritis in my hand (base of thumb and wrist). Is there anything I can do to stop my arthritic symptoms?
Bad science
I like to do my own research on difference products or treatments for my arthritis but I don’t have a science background- how can I tell if what I’m reading is from a trustworthy source or if the study I’m reading is of good quality?
Distraction therapy
What is distraction therapy for pain?
Stress and anxiety
Can you help me with the stress and anxiety associated with having arthritis?
Physical activity
I have arthritis and I get sore and stiff from yard and house hold work; I thought physical activity was good for me, so why do I feel sore or stiff after physical activity?
Medication
How do I talk to my doctor about medications?
Haemochromatosis
What are the links between Haemochromatosis and arthritis?
RA and exercise
There is a lot of focus on exercise for osteoarthritis (OA). I have Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and since RA is different to OA, can I and should I exercise?
Exercise and chronic pain
Is there anything I should and shouldn’t be doing when it comes to exercise and chronic pain?
Young people and arthritis
When I explain to people that I have Psoriatic Arthritis (or insert any other rheumatic autoimmune condition) they don’t understand why I have arthritis, and I feel it’s because I’m young and young people “don’t have arthritis”.
Posture
Do you have any tips on how to sit with good posture? My doctor told me I need to fix my posture to help with my low back and knee pain.
Strength training
I’m wanting to do some strength training but I’m not sure what weights to start on or how many reps I should be doing?
Subsidised Medicare
How do I access free and/or subsidised Medicare services?
Cortisone injections
What are the pros & cons of cortisone injections?
Fibro-fog
Please could you explain the whys & hows of the condition known as “fibro-fog” that fibromyalgia sufferers get sometimes?  Can it be ameliorated (improved) or even prevented?
