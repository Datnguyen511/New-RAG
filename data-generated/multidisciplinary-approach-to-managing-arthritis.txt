Multidisciplinary Approach to Managing Arthritis
------------------------------------------------

The Limitations of Medications Alone
------------------------------------
Medications for arthritis, such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), Analgesics, Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), and biologics, are essential for controlling inflammation, reducing pain, and slowing disease progression. However, they come with limitations and should be used in conjunction with other strategies:
Side Effects and Risks:
Long-term use of certain medications may lead to gastrointestinal issues, cardiovascular problems, and increased susceptibility to infections.
Limited Scope:
They do not improve overall health, lifestyle, or emotional wellbeing.
Relying solely on medications can lead to a cycle where symptoms are managed but not adequately controlled, and the overall health of someone may not improve. Incorporating other strategies is important  for a comprehensive management plan.
Understanding the Multidisciplinary Approach
A multidisciplinary approach involves a team of healthcare professionals from different specialties working together to provide holistic care.
This team might include your doctor, rheumatologists, physical therapists such as physiotherapists and/or exercise physiologist, occupational therapists, dietitians, psychologists, and sleep specialists.
Each specialist brings unique expertise to address the different aspects of arthritis management. Each person may require different healthcare professionals or techniques to manage their condition, as arthritis affects people differently.
Key Components of a Multidisciplinary Approach

Rheumatologist:
A rheumatologist specialises in diagnosing and treating inflammatory arthritis conditions.
They prescribe medications such as NSAIDs, DMARDs, biologics, and corticosteroids to control inflammation, relieve pain, and slow disease progression in inflammatory forms.

Multidisciplinary Approach to Managing Arthritis
------------------------------------------------

The Limitations of Medications Alone
------------------------------------
Medications for arthritis, such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), Analgesics, Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), and biologics, are essential for controlling inflammation, reducing pain, and slowing disease progression. However, they come with limitations and should be used in conjunction with other strategies:
Side Effects and Risks:
Long-term use of certain medications may lead to gastrointestinal issues, cardiovascular problems, and increased susceptibility to infections.
Limited Scope:
They do not improve overall health, lifestyle, or emotional wellbeing.
Relying solely on medications can lead to a cycle where symptoms are managed but not adequately controlled, and the overall health of someone may not improve. Incorporating other strategies is important  for a comprehensive management plan.
Understanding the Multidisciplinary Approach
A multidisciplinary approach involves a team of healthcare professionals from different specialties working together to provide holistic care.
This team might include your doctor, rheumatologists, physical therapists such as physiotherapists and/or exercise physiologist, occupational therapists, dietitians, psychologists, and sleep specialists.
Each specialist brings unique expertise to address the different aspects of arthritis management. Each person may require different healthcare professionals or techniques to manage their condition, as arthritis affects people differently.
Key Components of a Multidisciplinary Approach
#1. Medical Management
Rheumatologist:
A rheumatologist specialises in diagnosing and treating inflammatory arthritis conditions.
They prescribe medications such as NSAIDs, DMARDs, biologics, and corticosteroids to control inflammation, relieve pain, and slow disease progression in inflammatory forms.
Doctor (General Practitioner):
Your primary care doctor plays an important role in coordinating care and monitoring overall health.
They make sure all treatments support your general health and other medical conditions.
For more information, read our free article on
‘Making the Most of Your Visit to A Doctor’.
#2. Physical Therapy
Exercise Physiologist:
Exercise Physiologists (EP) design personalised exercise programs that are safe and effective to improve joint flexibility, muscle strength, and overall mobility.
Regular physical therapy can help reduce pain, enhance function, and prevent further joint damage.
An EP can show you how to do these exercises without causing as much pain or discomfort, and help you manage your symptoms like fatigue and loss of movement when practising your exercises.
For more information, read our free article on
‘Exercise Physiologist’
.
Physiotherapist:
Use hands-on treatment to manage conditions, disabilities, injuries, and disorders that affect your body’s movement and function.
Many people see physiotherapists after suffering an injury or illness that prevents them from moving freely.
They can prescribe specific exercises and stretches to help manage your arthritis symptoms.
For more information, read our free article on how a
‘Physiotherapist Can Help You’

The Limitations of Medications Alone
------------------------------------
Medications for arthritis, such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), Analgesics, Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), and biologics, are essential for controlling inflammation, reducing pain, and slowing disease progression. However, they come with limitations and should be used in conjunction with other strategies:
Side Effects and Risks:
Long-term use of certain medications may lead to gastrointestinal issues, cardiovascular problems, and increased susceptibility to infections.
Limited Scope:
They do not improve overall health, lifestyle, or emotional wellbeing.
Relying solely on medications can lead to a cycle where symptoms are managed but not adequately controlled, and the overall health of someone may not improve. Incorporating other strategies is important  for a comprehensive management plan.
Understanding the Multidisciplinary Approach
A multidisciplinary approach involves a team of healthcare professionals from different specialties working together to provide holistic care.
This team might include your doctor, rheumatologists, physical therapists such as physiotherapists and/or exercise physiologist, occupational therapists, dietitians, psychologists, and sleep specialists.
Each specialist brings unique expertise to address the different aspects of arthritis management. Each person may require different healthcare professionals or techniques to manage their condition, as arthritis affects people differently.
Key Components of a Multidisciplinary Approach
#1. Medical Management
Rheumatologist:
A rheumatologist specialises in diagnosing and treating inflammatory arthritis conditions.
They prescribe medications such as NSAIDs, DMARDs, biologics, and corticosteroids to control inflammation, relieve pain, and slow disease progression in inflammatory forms.
Doctor (General Practitioner):
Your primary care doctor plays an important role in coordinating care and monitoring overall health.
They make sure all treatments support your general health and other medical conditions.
For more information, read our free article on
‘Making the Most of Your Visit to A Doctor’.
#2. Physical Therapy
Exercise Physiologist:
Exercise Physiologists (EP) design personalised exercise programs that are safe and effective to improve joint flexibility, muscle strength, and overall mobility.
Regular physical therapy can help reduce pain, enhance function, and prevent further joint damage.
An EP can show you how to do these exercises without causing as much pain or discomfort, and help you manage your symptoms like fatigue and loss of movement when practising your exercises.
For more information, read our free article on
‘Exercise Physiologist’
.
Physiotherapist:
Use hands-on treatment to manage conditions, disabilities, injuries, and disorders that affect your body’s movement and function.
Many people see physiotherapists after suffering an injury or illness that prevents them from moving freely.
They can prescribe specific exercises and stretches to help manage your arthritis symptoms.
For more information, read our free article on how a
‘Physiotherapist Can Help You’
.
General Exercise:
Exercise is not just limited to seeing an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist. You can do your own exercise without seeing an allied health professional.
Exercise and physical activity have many benefits for arthritis management, including:
Improves Joint Flexibility and Function:
Regular physical activity helps maintain joint health, reduces stiffness, and improves mobility.
Strengthens Muscles & Reduces Inflammation:
Stronger muscles around the joints provide better support and may help reduce pain and inflammation.
Boosts Mental Health
: Physical activity releases endorphins, which can make you feel great and improve your mood.Exercise and physical activity have many benefits for arthritis management, including:
Examples may include and are not limited to:
Low-Impact Exercises:
Swimming, walking, and cycling can improve cardiovascular health without putting excessive strain on the joints.
Strength Training:
Light weights or resistance bands can help build muscle strength. Check out our Arthritis Moves exercise class.
Flexibility Exercises:
Yoga, Ballet, and stretching exercises improve flexibility and reduce stiffness. Check out our Dance for Arthritis class.
#3. Occupational Therapy
Occupational Therapist:
Occupational therapists help you adapt your daily activities to reduce joint strain and pain.

free article on Assistive Devices

#4. Nutrition and Diet

Arthritis is a common, chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide, causing joint pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility.
Living with arthritis can be challenging, but adopting a multidisciplinary approach can significantly improve your quality of life. Effective management of arthritis requires more than just medication; it involves a strategy that utilises various treatments and lifestyle modifications.
This article explores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to managing arthritis and how it can help you live well.
Medications for arthritis, such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), Analgesics, Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), and biologics, are essential for controlling inflammation, reducing pain, and slowing disease progression. However, they come with limitations and should be used in conjunction with other strategies:
Long-term use of certain medications may lead to gastrointestinal issues, cardiovascular problems, and increased susceptibility to infections.
They do not improve overall health, lifestyle, or emotional wellbeing.
Relying solely on medications can lead to a cycle where symptoms are managed but not adequately controlled, and the overall health of someone may not improve. Incorporating other strategies is important  for a comprehensive management plan.
A multidisciplinary approach involves a team of healthcare professionals from different specialties working together to provide holistic care.
This team might include your doctor, rheumatologists, physical therapists such as physiotherapists and/or exercise physiologist, occupational therapists, dietitians, psychologists, and sleep specialists.
Each specialist brings unique expertise to address the different aspects of arthritis management. Each person may require different healthcare professionals or techniques to manage their condition, as arthritis affects people differently.
A rheumatologist specialises in diagnosing and treating inflammatory arthritis conditions.
They prescribe medications such as NSAIDs, DMARDs, biologics, and corticosteroids to control inflammation, relieve pain, and slow disease progression in inflammatory forms.
Your primary care doctor plays an important role in coordinating care and monitoring overall health.
They make sure all treatments support your general health and other medical conditions.

Arthritis is a common, chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide, causing joint pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility.
Living with arthritis can be challenging, but adopting a multidisciplinary approach can significantly improve your quality of life. Effective management of arthritis requires more than just medication; it involves a strategy that utilises various treatments and lifestyle modifications.
This article explores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to managing arthritis and how it can help you live well.
Medications for arthritis, such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), Analgesics, Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), and biologics, are essential for controlling inflammation, reducing pain, and slowing disease progression. However, they come with limitations and should be used in conjunction with other strategies:
Long-term use of certain medications may lead to gastrointestinal issues, cardiovascular problems, and increased susceptibility to infections.
They do not improve overall health, lifestyle, or emotional wellbeing.
Relying solely on medications can lead to a cycle where symptoms are managed but not adequately controlled, and the overall health of someone may not improve. Incorporating other strategies is important  for a comprehensive management plan.
A multidisciplinary approach involves a team of healthcare professionals from different specialties working together to provide holistic care.
This team might include your doctor, rheumatologists, physical therapists such as physiotherapists and/or exercise physiologist, occupational therapists, dietitians, psychologists, and sleep specialists.
Each specialist brings unique expertise to address the different aspects of arthritis management. Each person may require different healthcare professionals or techniques to manage their condition, as arthritis affects people differently.
A rheumatologist specialises in diagnosing and treating inflammatory arthritis conditions.
They prescribe medications such as NSAIDs, DMARDs, biologics, and corticosteroids to control inflammation, relieve pain, and slow disease progression in inflammatory forms.
Your primary care doctor plays an important role in coordinating care and monitoring overall health.
They make sure all treatments support your general health and other medical conditions.
